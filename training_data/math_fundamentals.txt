# Mathematical Fundamentals and Reasoning
# Teaching ALEN to understand WHY math works, not just HOW

# ============================================================================
# FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS - Understanding WHY
# ============================================================================

# Identity and Equality
two equals two because they represent the same quantity
2 is 2 means both symbols represent identical values
equality means two expressions have the same value
the equals sign connects expressions of identical worth
identity property states a number equals itself
reflexive property says any value equals itself

# Number Representation
numbers are symbols representing quantities
the symbol 2 represents a quantity of two units
numerals are written symbols for abstract quantities
place value determines meaning based on position
decimal system uses powers of ten for positions
each digit position is ten times the previous position

# Zero and One - Special Numbers
zero represents absence or nothing
zero is the additive identity because adding zero changes nothing
one is the multiplicative identity because multiplying by one changes nothing
zero times any number equals zero because zero groups contain nothing
one times any number equals that number because one group contains all items
dividing by zero is undefined because you cannot split into zero parts

# Addition - Combining Quantities
addition means combining separate quantities into one total
2 plus 3 equals 5 because combining two and three gives five total
commutative property means order does not matter in addition
3 plus 2 equals 2 plus 3 because total is same regardless of order
associative property means grouping does not matter in addition
adding zero does nothing because you add no quantity

# Subtraction - Removing Quantities
subtraction means removing a quantity from a total
5 minus 2 equals 3 because removing two from five leaves three
subtraction is the inverse of addition
8 minus 3 equals 5 because 5 plus 3 equals 8
subtracting zero leaves the number unchanged
subtracting a number from itself always gives zero

# Multiplication - Repeated Addition
multiplication is repeated addition of the same number
3 times 4 means adding 4 three times which equals 12
4 multiplied by 3 means three groups of four items
commutative property means 3 times 4 equals 4 times 3
distributive property means 3 times (4 plus 5) equals (3 times 4) plus (3 times 5)
multiplying by one keeps the number the same
multiplying by zero always gives zero

# Division - Equal Sharing
division means splitting a quantity into equal parts
12 divided by 3 means splitting twelve into three equal groups of four
division is the inverse of multiplication
12 divided by 3 equals 4 because 4 times 3 equals 12
dividing by one keeps the number the same
dividing a number by itself always gives one

# Fractions - Parts of Wholes
a fraction represents parts of a whole
one half means one part out of two equal parts
the numerator shows how many parts you have
the denominator shows how many equal parts make the whole
equivalent fractions represent the same portion using different numbers
simplifying fractions means reducing to smallest whole numbers

# ============================================================================
# FORMULA CONSTRUCTION - Professional Mathematical Writing
# ============================================================================

# Formula Structure
a mathematical formula expresses relationships between quantities
formulas use variables to represent changeable values
constants are fixed values that never change
equals sign shows both sides have identical value
left side and right side must balance perfectly

# Variable Naming Conventions
use meaningful variable names that indicate purpose
single letters often represent standard quantities like x for unknown
subscripts distinguish similar variables like x1 and x2
capital letters sometimes indicate different types than lowercase
Greek letters often represent angles or special constants

# Operator Usage
addition symbol plus combines quantities
subtraction symbol minus removes quantities
multiplication symbol times creates products
division symbol over creates quotients
exponentiation symbol caret raises to powers
parentheses group operations to control order
square brackets show nested groupings
absolute value bars indicate magnitude without sign

# Order of Operations
parentheses are evaluated first in any expression
exponents are calculated second after parentheses
multiplication and division are performed third from left to right
addition and subtraction are performed last from left to right
PEMDAS helps remember parentheses exponents multiplication division addition subtraction
correct order prevents ambiguity in complex expressions

# Creating Formulas from Words
identify what quantity you want to calculate
determine what information you have available
write relationships between known and unknown quantities
use operations that match the described relationship
test formula with simple numbers to verify correctness
rearrange formula to solve for desired variable

# Formula Manipulation
isolate variable by performing same operation on both sides
adding same value to both sides maintains equality
multiplying both sides by same nonzero value maintains equality
whatever you do to one side must be done to other side
inverse operations undo each other to isolate variables
division undoes multiplication and subtraction undoes addition

# ============================================================================
# MATHEMATICAL REASONING - Understanding Proofs
# ============================================================================

# Logical Structure
mathematical proof shows why something must be true
premises are starting facts we accept as true
logical steps connect premises to conclusion
each step follows necessarily from previous steps
conclusion is unavoidable if premises are true

# Deductive Reasoning
deductive reasoning moves from general to specific
if all A are B and C is A then C must be B
valid deduction guarantees truth of conclusion
premise all numbers equal themselves is universally true
therefore 2 equals 2 by deductive reasoning

# Proof by Example vs General Proof
example shows formula works for specific case
general proof shows formula works for all cases
one example cannot prove universal statement
one counterexample can disprove universal statement
mathematical induction proves statements for all natural numbers

# Why Mathematical Facts Are True
2 plus 2 equals 4 because combining two pairs makes four total
distributive property holds because grouping affects neither total nor product
Pythagorean theorem follows from properties of right triangles
mathematical truths follow necessarily from definitions and axioms

# ============================================================================
# ALGEBRAIC THINKING
# ============================================================================

# Variables as Unknowns
variable represents quantity we do not yet know
solving means finding what value makes equation true
equation states that two expressions are equal
solution is value that satisfies the equation
checking solution means substituting back into original equation

# Linear Equations
linear equation has variables to first power only
slope measures rate of change between variables
y equals mx plus b represents line with slope m and intercept b
solving linear equation isolates variable on one side
parallel lines have equal slopes but different intercepts

# Quadratic Equations
quadratic equation has variable to second power
standard form is ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero
quadratic formula solves any quadratic equation
factoring finds values that make expression equal zero
parabola is graph of quadratic function

# ============================================================================
# GEOMETRIC REASONING
# ============================================================================

# Basic Shapes
triangle has three sides and three angles
sum of angles in triangle always equals 180 degrees
square has four equal sides and four right angles
circle has all points equidistant from center
perimeter measures distance around shape
area measures space inside shape

# Measurement Formulas
area of rectangle equals length times width
area of triangle equals one half base times height
area of circle equals pi times radius squared
circumference of circle equals two times pi times radius
volume of cube equals side length cubed
volume of cylinder equals pi times radius squared times height

# Pythagorean Theorem
in right triangle a squared plus b squared equals c squared
c represents hypotenuse the longest side
a and b represent legs the shorter sides
theorem works because of geometric relationship in right triangles
proof shows why relationship must always hold

# ============================================================================
# PROPORTIONAL REASONING
# ============================================================================

# Ratios and Rates
ratio compares two quantities
rate compares quantities with different units
proportion states two ratios are equal
cross multiplication tests if ratios are equal
unit rate has denominator of one

# Percentage Calculations
percent means per hundred or out of hundred
to find percent multiply by fraction over hundred
50 percent means 50 out of 100 or one half
percent increase compares new to original amount
percent decrease shows reduction from original

# Scaling and Similarity
similar figures have same shape but different size
corresponding sides of similar figures form equal ratios
scale factor multiplies all dimensions equally
doubling all sides of square quadruples area
tripling all dimensions of cube multiplies volume by twenty seven

# ============================================================================
# PATTERN RECOGNITION
# ============================================================================

# Sequences and Series
sequence is ordered list following pattern
arithmetic sequence adds same value each time
geometric sequence multiplies by same value each time
series is sum of sequence terms
finding pattern helps predict future terms

# Functions as Patterns
function maps each input to exactly one output
f of x notation represents function value at x
domain is set of valid input values
range is set of possible output values
linear function has constant rate of change

# ============================================================================
# MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE
# ============================================================================

# Precise Mathematical Communication
sum means result of addition
difference means result of subtraction
product means result of multiplication
quotient means result of division
term refers to parts separated by addition or subtraction
factor refers to numbers being multiplied

# Comparative Language
greater than means first value exceeds second
less than means first value is smaller than second
greater than or equal to includes equality case
inequality compares values without equality
approximately equal indicates close but not exact

# Quantitative Relationships
directly proportional means both increase together
inversely proportional means one increases as other decreases
rate of change measures how one quantity varies with another
constant value never changes
variable value can change based on conditions

# ============================================================================
# PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES - Why They Work
# ============================================================================

# Commutative Property
addition is commutative because order of combining does not matter
3 plus 5 equals 5 plus 3 because total is same
multiplication is commutative because grouping count is same
3 times 5 equals 5 times 3 both give fifteen
subtraction is not commutative because order matters
division is not commutative because order affects result

# Associative Property
addition is associative because grouping does not change sum
(2 plus 3) plus 4 equals 2 plus (3 plus 4) both equal 9
multiplication is associative because grouping does not change product
(2 times 3) times 4 equals 2 times (3 times 4) both equal 24
parentheses indicate which operation to perform first

# Distributive Property
multiplication distributes over addition
3 times (4 plus 5) equals (3 times 4) plus (3 times 5)
this works because each item in group gets multiplied
distributing simplifies complex expressions
factoring is reverse of distributing

# Identity Properties
adding zero is identity for addition
any number plus zero equals that number
multiplying by one is identity for multiplication
any number times one equals that number
identities preserve the original value

# Inverse Properties
additive inverse makes sum equal zero
3 plus negative 3 equals 0
multiplicative inverse makes product equal one
5 times one fifth equals 1
inverses undo the original operation
