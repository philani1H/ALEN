# COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING: ALL TYPES OF THINKING
# This teaches the AI HOW to think in every way humans think

# ============================================================
# LOGICAL THINKING
# ============================================================

# Deductive Reasoning
All humans are mortal. Socrates is human. Therefore? -> Socrates is mortal. This follows from deductive logic where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.
If it rains, the ground gets wet. It's raining. What happens? -> The ground gets wet. This is a valid deductive inference using modus ponens.
All cats are mammals. All mammals are animals. Therefore? -> All cats are animals. This is a syllogism showing transitive property of logical categories.

# Inductive Reasoning
The sun has risen every day for billions of years. Will it rise tomorrow? -> Very likely yes. Inductive reasoning suggests patterns will continue, though it's not certain like deduction.
Every swan I've seen is white. Are all swans white? -> Not necessarily. This shows the limitation of inductive reasoning - one black swan disproves the generalization.
I've eaten at this restaurant 10 times and it was good each time. Will it be good next time? -> Probably, but not guaranteed. Past patterns suggest future outcomes but don't guarantee them.

# Abductive Reasoning
The grass is wet. What's the most likely explanation? -> It probably rained, though other explanations (sprinkler, dew) are possible. Abduction finds the best explanation.
My friend didn't reply to my message. Why? -> They might be busy, didn't see it, or their phone died. Abduction considers multiple plausible explanations.
The car won't start. What could be wrong? -> Most likely the battery is dead, but could be fuel, starter, or other issues. Abduction generates hypotheses to test.

# ============================================================
# CRITICAL THINKING
# ============================================================

# Analyzing Arguments
"Everyone says this is true, so it must be." Is this valid? -> No, this is argumentum ad populum (appeal to popularity). Truth isn't determined by consensus.
"You can't prove it's false, so it must be true." Valid? -> No, this is argument from ignorance. Lack of disproof doesn't prove something true.
"This expert says X, therefore X is true." Valid? -> Not automatically. Even experts can be wrong. Consider evidence, not just authority.

# Identifying Bias
I only read news that confirms my beliefs. What's the problem? -> This is confirmation bias - seeking only information that supports existing views while ignoring contradictory evidence.
I judge this idea based on who said it, not the idea itself. What bias? -> This is ad hominem bias - evaluating ideas based on the source rather than merit.
I remember the times I was right but forget when I was wrong. What's this? -> This is selective memory or hindsight bias - remembering successes more than failures.

# Evaluating Evidence
Someone claims X. What should I ask? -> Ask for evidence, check sources, consider alternative explanations, look for bias, and verify independently.
How do I know if a source is reliable? -> Check credentials, look for peer review, verify with multiple sources, check for conflicts of interest, and examine methodology.
What makes evidence strong? -> Strong evidence is reproducible, comes from reliable sources, uses sound methodology, and is consistent across multiple studies.

# ============================================================
# CREATIVE THINKING
# ============================================================

# Divergent Thinking
How many uses can you think of for a brick? -> Building material, doorstop, weapon, weight, art sculpture, heat sink, paperweight, garden border, exercise weight, and many more creative uses.
What if gravity worked backwards? -> Objects would fall upward, we'd need to anchor ourselves, rain would go up, planets might fly apart - exploring impossible scenarios sparks creativity.
Combine a phone and a plant. What do you get? -> A device that grows, needs sunlight, produces oxygen, biodegradable, or monitors plant health - combining unrelated concepts creates innovation.

# Lateral Thinking
A man walks into a bar and asks for water. The bartender pulls out a gun. The man says thanks and leaves. Why? -> The man had hiccups. The bartender scared him to cure them. Lateral thinking finds unexpected solutions.
How do you fit 10 horses in 9 stables? -> T-E-N H-O-R-S-E-S - one letter per stable. Lateral thinking challenges assumptions about the problem.
A woman has two coins totaling 30 cents. One is not a nickel. What are they? -> A quarter and a nickel. One (the quarter) is not a nickel, but the other is. Lateral thinking finds the trick.

# Analogical Thinking
How is a brain like a computer? -> Both process information, store memories, have inputs/outputs, can be programmed, and solve problems - but brains are biological and more flexible.
How is a company like an organism? -> Both have systems (organs/departments), need resources (food/money), adapt to environment, grow, and can die if unhealthy.
How is learning like building a house? -> Both need a foundation (basics), structure (framework), materials (knowledge), and time. Rushing either leads to weakness.

# ============================================================
# ANALYTICAL THINKING
# ============================================================

# Breaking Down Complex Problems
How do you solve world hunger? -> Break it down: food production, distribution, poverty, education, infrastructure, politics, climate. Address each systematically.
How do you build a successful business? -> Analyze components: market need, product/service, customers, revenue model, operations, marketing, team, funding, scaling.
How do you improve education? -> Decompose: curriculum, teaching methods, student engagement, resources, assessment, teacher training, technology, accessibility.

# Pattern Recognition
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... What's next? -> 21. This is the Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two.
What pattern: OTTFFSS? -> One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven - first letters of numbers. Next would be E (Eight).
Monday, Wednesday, Friday... What's the pattern? -> Every other day. The pattern is skipping one day between each.

# Cause and Effect Analysis
Why did the Roman Empire fall? -> Multiple causes: economic troubles, military overspending, political instability, barbarian invasions, division of empire, moral decay - complex causation.
What causes poverty? -> Interconnected factors: lack of education, limited opportunities, systemic inequality, poor governance, geographic disadvantages, historical exploitation.
Why do people procrastinate? -> Various causes: fear of failure, perfectionism, lack of motivation, poor time management, task aversion, immediate gratification bias.

# ============================================================
# SYNTHETIC THINKING
# ============================================================

# Combining Ideas
Merge democracy and technology. What emerges? -> Digital voting, online town halls, blockchain governance, AI-assisted policy analysis, transparent government data, citizen participation platforms.
Combine education and gaming. Result? -> Gamified learning, educational video games, achievement systems for studying, competitive learning, immersive educational experiences.
Mix art and science. What do you get? -> Scientific visualization, medical illustration, architectural design, data art, biomimicry, mathematical art, science communication through art.

# Systems Thinking
How does changing one thing affect the whole system? -> In ecosystems, removing one species affects food chains. In economies, changing interest rates affects spending, investment, employment, inflation.
What are the interconnections in a city? -> Transportation affects housing prices, which affects demographics, which affects schools, which affects property values - everything connects.
How do feedback loops work? -> Positive feedback amplifies change (rich get richer), negative feedback stabilizes (thermostat). Both shape system behavior.

# Holistic Thinking
How do you understand a person completely? -> Consider their biology, psychology, relationships, culture, history, environment, beliefs, experiences, goals - the whole person, not just parts.
What's the big picture of climate change? -> Not just temperature, but interconnected effects on weather, ecosystems, agriculture, economy, migration, politics, health, society.
How do you see the whole forest, not just trees? -> Step back, look for patterns, understand relationships, see long-term trends, recognize the system's purpose and dynamics.

# ============================================================
# EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
# ============================================================

# Self-Awareness
Why am I feeling this way? -> Emotions arise from thoughts, experiences, needs, and circumstances. Identifying the source helps understand and manage feelings.
What are my strengths and weaknesses? -> Honest self-assessment requires reflection, feedback from others, and recognizing patterns in successes and struggles.
What triggers my emotions? -> Certain situations, people, memories, or thoughts activate emotional responses. Awareness of triggers enables better emotional regulation.

# Empathy
How does the other person feel? -> Put yourself in their position, consider their perspective, observe their expressions and body language, listen to their words and tone.
Why might someone act that way? -> People's behavior makes sense from their perspective. Consider their experiences, beliefs, fears, needs, and circumstances.
What would I feel in their situation? -> Imagining yourself in someone else's circumstances builds empathy and understanding of their emotional state.

# Social Awareness
How do I read the room? -> Observe body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, energy level, group dynamics, and unspoken tensions or agreements.
What's the group dynamic here? -> Notice who leads, who follows, alliances, conflicts, power structures, communication patterns, and emotional undercurrents.
How do cultural differences affect interaction? -> Different cultures have varying norms for communication, personal space, eye contact, directness, time, and emotional expression.

# ============================================================
# STRATEGIC THINKING
# ============================================================

# Long-term Planning
What's my 10-year goal? -> Define the destination, work backwards to identify milestones, consider obstacles, plan resources, and create actionable steps.
How do I prepare for the future? -> Anticipate trends, build adaptable skills, create multiple options, save resources, build networks, and stay flexible.
What's the best path forward? -> Evaluate options, consider consequences, assess risks and rewards, align with values and goals, and choose strategically.

# Risk Assessment
What could go wrong? -> Identify potential failures, estimate probability and impact, plan mitigation strategies, and prepare contingencies.
Is this risk worth taking? -> Compare potential gains vs. losses, consider your risk tolerance, evaluate alternatives, and make informed decisions.
How do I minimize risk? -> Diversify, gather information, start small, test assumptions, have backup plans, and learn from others' mistakes.

# Resource Optimization
How do I get the most from limited resources? -> Prioritize high-impact activities, eliminate waste, leverage strengths, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on efficiency.
What's the best use of my time? -> Focus on important over urgent, delegate when possible, batch similar tasks, eliminate distractions, and align with goals.
How do I maximize value? -> Identify what creates most value, invest there, cut low-value activities, and continuously improve processes.

# ============================================================
# PROBLEM-SOLVING
# ============================================================

# Defining Problems
What's the real problem here? -> Look beyond symptoms to root causes. Ask "why" repeatedly to dig deeper. Distinguish between problem and solution.
How do I frame this problem? -> Define clearly, identify constraints, determine success criteria, and consider different perspectives on the issue.
What problem am I actually trying to solve? -> Sometimes we solve the wrong problem. Ensure you understand the true need before seeking solutions.

# Generating Solutions
What are all possible solutions? -> Brainstorm without judgment, consider conventional and unconventional approaches, combine ideas, and think from different angles.
How would others solve this? -> Consider how experts, children, artists, scientists, or people from different cultures might approach the problem.
What if I had unlimited resources? -> Removing constraints temporarily can reveal ideal solutions, which can then be adapted to real constraints.

# Evaluating Solutions
Which solution is best? -> Compare against criteria: effectiveness, feasibility, cost, time, risks, side effects, and alignment with goals.
What are the trade-offs? -> Every solution has pros and cons. Identify them explicitly and decide which trade-offs are acceptable.
How do I test this solution? -> Start small, measure results, gather feedback, iterate based on learning, and scale what works.

# ============================================================
# DECISION-MAKING
# ============================================================

# Weighing Options
How do I choose between A and B? -> List pros and cons, consider long-term consequences, align with values, trust intuition informed by analysis.
What factors matter most? -> Identify key criteria, weight them by importance, score options against each, and calculate overall scores.
How do I decide under uncertainty? -> Gather available information, assess probabilities, consider worst/best cases, and make the best decision with incomplete data.

# Avoiding Decision Paralysis
I can't decide. What do I do? -> Set a deadline, limit options, accept that perfect information is impossible, and remember that not deciding is also a decision.
What if I make the wrong choice? -> Most decisions are reversible. Learn from mistakes, adjust course, and remember that action beats perfect planning.
How do I trust my decision? -> Combine rational analysis with intuition, consult trusted advisors, and commit once decided rather than second-guessing.

# Learning from Decisions
What can I learn from this outcome? -> Analyze what worked and what didn't, identify factors you controlled vs. didn't, and extract lessons for future decisions.
How do I improve my decision-making? -> Track decisions and outcomes, identify patterns in good and bad decisions, seek feedback, and study decision-making frameworks.
When should I change my mind? -> When new evidence emerges, circumstances change significantly, or you realize your initial reasoning was flawed.

# ============================================================
# METACOGNITION (Thinking About Thinking)
# ============================================================

# Monitoring Understanding
Do I really understand this? -> Test yourself, explain it to others, apply it to new situations, and identify gaps in your knowledge.
What don't I know? -> Recognize the limits of your knowledge, identify assumptions, and distinguish between what you know and what you think you know.
How can I check my understanding? -> Ask questions, seek feedback, test predictions, and look for contradictions in your mental model.

# Cognitive Strategies
How do I learn this best? -> Match strategy to content: visualization for spatial concepts, practice for skills, elaboration for facts, and teaching for deep understanding.
What's my thinking process? -> Observe your own thoughts, notice patterns, identify effective and ineffective strategies, and consciously choose approaches.
How do I improve my thinking? -> Practice deliberately, seek diverse perspectives, challenge assumptions, learn from mistakes, and study thinking itself.

# Reflection
What did I learn from this experience? -> Extract lessons, identify what worked and what didn't, recognize patterns, and plan how to apply learning.
How has my thinking changed? -> Notice shifts in beliefs, understanding, or approaches. Recognize growth and areas still needing development.
What would I do differently? -> Honest reflection on past decisions and actions reveals opportunities for improvement and growth.

# ============================================================
# PRACTICAL WISDOM
# ============================================================

# Judgment
When should I act vs. wait? -> Act when delay costs more than action, wait when more information would significantly improve the decision.
How do I balance competing values? -> Recognize that values sometimes conflict, consider context, and make conscious choices about priorities.
What's the wise thing to do? -> Combine knowledge, experience, values, and judgment to choose actions that serve long-term wellbeing.

# Common Sense
What's the obvious answer? -> Sometimes we overthink. The simplest, most straightforward solution is often correct (Occam's Razor).
What would a reasonable person do? -> Consider social norms, practical constraints, and common human experience to guide action.
Is this too good to be true? -> Healthy skepticism protects against scams, unrealistic promises, and wishful thinking.

# Adaptability
How do I adjust to change? -> Accept that change is constant, stay flexible, learn continuously, and view challenges as opportunities.
What do I do when plans fail? -> Have backup plans, improvise with available resources, learn from failure, and pivot when necessary.
How do I stay relevant? -> Keep learning, embrace new technologies and ideas, build diverse skills, and remain open to change.
