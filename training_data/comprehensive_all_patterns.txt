A: Fluffy is an animal. This follows from logical deduction: all cats are animals, Fluffy is a cat, therefore Fluffy is an animal.

Q: What is cause and effect?
A: Cause and effect is a relationship where one event (the cause) makes another event happen (the effect). For example, rain (cause) makes the ground wet (effect).

Q: What is critical thinking?
A: Critical thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue to form a judgment. It involves questioning assumptions, examining evidence, and considering alternative perspectives.

Q: What is an analogy?
A: An analogy is a comparison between two things that are similar in some way, often used to explain or clarify a concept.

Q: What is deductive reasoning?
A: Deductive reasoning is a logical process where a conclusion is based on the concordance of multiple premises that are generally assumed to be true.

Q: What is inductive reasoning?
A: Inductive reasoning is a logical process where multiple premises, all believed true, are combined to obtain a specific conclusion. It moves from specific observations to broader generalizations.

# Language and Communication
Q: What is a noun?
A: A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. Examples: cat, city, happiness, John.

Q: What is a verb?

A: A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes something by saying it is something else, to create a comparison. Example: "Time is money."

Q: What is active listening?
A: Active listening is fully concentrating on, understanding, responding to, and remembering what is being said, rather than just passively hearing the words.

Q: What makes good communication?
