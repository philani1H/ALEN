Q: What is 15 multiplied by 7?
A: 15 multiplied by 7 equals 105. We can verify this: 15 × 7 = (10 × 7) + (5 × 7) = 70 + 35 = 105.

Q: If f(x) = 3x + 2, what is f(4)?
A: Substituting x = 4 into f(x) = 3x + 2: f(4) = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14.

Q: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13
A: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4.

Q: What is the area of a circle with radius 5?
A: The area of a circle is πr². With r = 5: Area = π(5)² = 25π ≈ 78.54 square units.

Q: What is the integral of 2x?
A: The integral of 2x with respect to x is x² + C, where C is the constant of integration. This follows from the power rule for integration.

Q: Factor x² - 9.
A: x² - 9 is a difference of squares: x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3).

Q: What is log₂(16)?
A: log₂(16) = 4, because 2⁴ = 16.

Q: Simplify: (x³)² × x⁴
A: Using exponent rules: (x³)² = x⁶, then x⁶ × x⁴ = x¹⁰.

Q: What is the slope of the line passing through points (2, 3) and (5, 9)?
A: Slope = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = (9 - 3)/(5 - 2) = 6/3 = 2.

Q: Solve the quadratic equation: x² - 5x + 6 = 0
A: Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0. Therefore x = 2 or x = 3.

Q: What is the determinant of [[2, 3], [1, 4]]?
A: For a 2×2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], det = ad - bc. Here: (2)(4) - (3)(1) = 8 - 3 = 5.

Q: Convert 45 degrees to radians.
A: 45° = 45 × (π/180) = π/4 radians.

Q: What is the sum of the first 10 positive integers?
A: Using the formula n(n+1)/2 with n=10: 10(11)/2 = 55.

Q: Differentiate sin(x) cos(x).
A: Using the product rule: d/dx[sin(x)cos(x)] = cos(x)cos(x) + sin(x)(-sin(x)) = cos²(x) - sin²(x) = cos(2x).

Q: What is the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two fair dice?
A: There are 6 ways to roll 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) out of 36 total outcomes. Probability = 6/36 = 1/6.

Q: Evaluate: lim(x→0) sin(x)/x
A: This is a fundamental limit: lim(x→0) sin(x)/x = 1.

Q: What is the geometric mean of 4 and 9?
A: Geometric mean = √(4 × 9) = √36 = 6.

Q: Express 0.333... as a fraction.
A: 0.333... = 1/3. We can verify: 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333...

Q: What is e^(ln(5))?
A: e^(ln(5)) = 5, because e^x and ln(x) are inverse functions.

Q: Find the distance between points (1, 2) and (4, 6).
A: Distance = √[(4-1)² + (6-2)²] = √[9 + 16] = √25 = 5.

Q: What is 2³ × 2⁵?
A: Using exponent rules: 2³ × 2⁵ = 2⁸ = 256.

Q: Simplify: √(50)
A: √(50) = √(25 × 2) = 5√2.

Q: What is the volume of a sphere with radius 3?
A: Volume = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(3)³ = (4/3)π(27) = 36π ≈ 113.1 cubic units.

Q: Solve for y: 3y - 7 = 2y + 5
A: Subtract 2y from both sides: y - 7 = 5. Add 7: y = 12.

Q: What is the sum of angles in a hexagon?
A: Sum of interior angles = (n-2) × 180° where n=6: (6-2) × 180° = 720°.

Q: Evaluate: ∫₀¹ x dx
A: ∫₀¹ x dx = [x²/2]₀¹ = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2.

Q: What is 5! (5 factorial)?
A: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Q: Convert 1/8 to a decimal.
A: 1/8 = 0.125.

Q: What is the perimeter of a rectangle with length 7 and width 4?
A: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(7 + 4) = 2(11) = 22 units.

Q: Simplify: (2x + 3x²) - (x - x²)
A: (2x + 3x²) - (x - x²) = 2x + 3x² - x + x² = x + 4x².
